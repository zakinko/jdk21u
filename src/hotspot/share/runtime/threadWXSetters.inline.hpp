//
// Per https://cr.openjdk.org/~jrose/jvm/hotspot-cmc.html, HotSpot
// will cross-modify code.
//
// To workaround the potential subtle race issues outlined in the
// paper linked to above, HotSpot calls pthread_jit_write_protect_np()
// on Darwin/aarch64.  On other OSes, different workarounds are applied,
// but some of these appear Cortex specific and are not sufficient on
// NetBSD and FreeBSD when running on Apple Silicon (see
// https://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-pkg/2025/07/12/msg031385.html and
// https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=265284).
//
// Using pthread_jit_write_protect_np() will temporarily write-protect
// every executable page in the process space for the calling thread,
// so that the thread can execute code in pages that are otherwise
// writable.  The important part, from our perspective, is that the
// function happens to issue data and instruction memory barriers
// (i.e. DSB and ISB).  These are enough to address the issues on
// NetBSD and FreeBSD.
//
// To that end, issue these memory barriers every time Darwin would
// call pthread_jit_write_protect_np().  This is implemented below and
// by the calls to BSD_AARCH64_ONLY(ThreadWXEnable wx(WXWrite, <thread>)
// throughout the code (formerly BSD_AARCH64_ONLY).
//
// Notes:
// 1. This has a negative performance impact on Cortex chips, but we'll
//    accept that in favour of correctness overall
// 2. OpenBSD doesn't seem to be impacted by this, although it is not
//    clear why that is
