# Writes a set of <triple>-clang wrappers that drive the host clang at a BSD
# sysroot, plus the llvm binutils under the names the build looks for.  A
# wrapper rather than a set of flags because configure records the compiler
# as one word and passes it around that way.
#
# Usage: gen-bsd-crosstool.sh <os> <triple> <sysroot> <bindir> [suffix]
#
# The suffix picks a particular LLVM, as in "-20" for clang-20 and
# llvm-nm-20.  Some targets need one: clang 18 crashes in the post-RA
# pass on aarch64-unknown-openbsd.  Without it the unversioned tools
# are used.

# NetBSD and DragonFly ship libstdc++, and neither puts its headers where

# DragonFly splits them, with the headers proper under /usr/include/c++/<ver>
# and the target-specific bits/c++config.h off in /usr/libdata/gcc<ver>.
# Getting that wrong is not an error -- clang falls back to the host's headers
# and compiles Ubuntu's declarations against DragonFly's system headers, which
# comes apart much later as exception specifications that do not match.
# FreeBSD and OpenBSD ship libc++, which clang finds by itself.
